# Programming with Python

Python is a versatile programming language. Python is considered a high-level programming software. This is opposed to low-level languages like Machine code or assembly. The difference is readability or what the user inputs command look like for the computer to process. Machine-code is usually decimal, octal or hexidecimal sets which get converted to binary. Python uses language that is much more human-readable.

Python is a valuable tool for researchers as well because it provides methods to create tools that you might use over and over as well as evaluate and visualize data sets.

## Analyzing Patient Data

Python also incoporates tools that are designed to make our lives easier, called _libraries_.

One way to think about libraries is as a bookshelf full of books. In a real world library, books are grouped together by a common theme. Python libraries are similar in that they are collections of tools based around a common theme.
