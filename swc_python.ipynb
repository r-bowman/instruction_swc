    "Python is a versatile programming language. Programming languages can be divided along many lines, but in particular, Python is considered a high-level programming software. This is opposed to low-level languages like Machine code or assembly. The difference is readability or what the user input commands look like for the computer to process. Machine-code is usually decimal, octal or hexidecimal sets which get converted to binary. Python uses language that is much more human-readable.\n",

We're only going to add a couple of new things here to increase readability. The first element is matplotlib.pyplot.figure(); this creates a special space for us to put our graphs into. Figsize is an element of .figure that helps dictate how large the images will be. Lastly we're going to group our images using subplots. We're also going to pretend we haven't typed anything above this new cell.\n",
